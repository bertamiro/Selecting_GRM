\frametitle{Post-genomics age 1.0}
\label{sec-1-1}
\begin{itemize}

\item The availability of the human genome sequence allowed us to
  start an age of high throughput studies where techniques such as
  microarrays became of common use.
\label{sec-1-1-1}%

\item This represented a \emph{change of paradigm} where scientists
  moved from being able of looking at a few genes at a time to the
  possibility of simultaneously studying the expression of all genes
  in one or more experimental conditions.
\label{sec-1-1-2}%

\item This approach was not free of noise or problem and it gave rise
  to an intense statistical activity.

\item In a few years these ``new'' approaches have started to be overcome by two important facts:

\begin{itemize}
\item The advent of \emph{next generation sequencing}, providing powerful ways to yield improved information on many type of genomic, transcriptomic or epigenomic data.

\label{sec-1.8}
\begin{itemize}
\item One main epigenetic regulatory mechanisms is methylation a process by which a gene's behavior is altered, but the gene itself isn't changed.\\
\label{sec-1.8.1}
\item Essentially methylation acts by inhibiting gene expression that is the more methylated is a gene the more repressed is its expression\\
\label{sec-1.8.2}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{./images/methylationAction1.png}
%\item Methylation is seen however as a dual phenomenon\\
%\label{sec-1.8.3}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item A methylated gene is "off"\\
%\label{sec-1.8.3.1}
%\item An unmethlated gene is "on"\\
%\label{sec-1.8.3.2}
%\end{itemize} % ends low level
%\item So in practice an important practical problem is to determine at which methylation level a gene is seen as "methylated" (that is turned off).\\

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Gene-specific methylation on-off threshold}

\begin{frame}{}
\begin{itemize}
\item Since measurements for methylation and expression are both
continuous, a biaxial plot of these two signals will exhibit an
L-shape pattern. 
\item If we truly
believe that methylation is binary, there are two implications:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the reflection point of the L-shape is an appropriate choice
to binarize methylation data, and
\item conditioning on the
binarized on-off methylation status, the continuous valued
methylation data and expression data should be independent,
\end{enumerate}
which motivates Liu(2012) to quantify the L-shape pattern using
conditional mutual information (MI). 
\end{itemize}

%In this section, we
%use TCGA data to ask 

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Conditional Mutual Information}
Two questions: which genes exhibit
L-shape, and what is the optimal threshold for binarizing
methylation data for each L-shape gene.
\begin{block}{The key}
To determine whether methylation and expression of a gene exhibit an L-shape,
we compute the conditional Mutual Information (MI) for different choices of threshold
to binarize the methylation data.
\end{block}
If we consider the continuous valued methylation and expression data as two random variables
$X$ and $Y$, and denote a nominal threshold as $t$, the conditional MI can be written as a
weighted sum of MIs on the two sides of the threshold.
\[
\mathit{cMI}(t)=I(X,Y|X>t)P(X>t) + I(X,Y|X\le t)P(X\le t)
\]
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Optimal threshold}
When $t$ is $0$ or $1$, $\mathit{cMI}$ equals to the mutual information derived 
from all data points.

For an L-shape gene, as $t$ moves from 0 to 1, $\mathit{cMI}(t)$ first decreases and then
increases, and its value approaches zero when $t$ coincides with the reflection point. 
Therefore,
\begin{block}{Optimal threshold}
The ratio $r=\frac{\min\{\mathit{cMI}(t)\}}{\mathit{cMI}(0)}$ for an L-shape gene is small, 
and $t^{\ast} = \mathrm{argmin}\{ \mathit{cMI}(t) \}$ is the optimal threshold for 
dichotomizing the methylation data of this gene.
\end{block}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Joint distribution estimator}
To estimate the MI terms we use a kernel-based estimator, which constructs a joint
probability distribution by applying a Gaussian kernel to each data point, and estimates
the MI based on the joint distribution. The estimator is as follows:
\[
I(X,Y) = \frac 1M \sum_{i=1}^M \log\frac{M\sum_{j=1}^M e^{-\frac{1}{2h^2}((x_i-x_j)^2+(y_i-y_j)^2)}}{%
                                      \sum_{j=1}^M e^{-\frac{1}{2h^2}(x_i-x_j)^2} \sum_{j=1}^M e^{-\frac{1}{2h^2}(y_i-y_j)^2}}
\]
where $h$ is a tuning parameter for the kernel width and empirically set $h=0.3$.
% i and j are indices for samples.
% In our analysis, we normalize the expression data to zero mean.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{L-shapes}
\begin{block}{Three criteria}
We filtered for L-shapes using a combination of three criteria:
\begin{itemize}
\item the ratio $r<0.25$
\item unconditioned MI $\mathit{cMI}(0)>0.1$
\item the median expression on the left side of the optimal threshold $t^{\ast}$ is higher
than the median expression on the right side.
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
The parameters are chosen according to a random permutation test (see Liu(2012)).

According to the above criteria, a total of 641 genes are selected to be L-shape genes.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Clustering using Spline regression }
We implemented regression based on  $B-splines$ because they are particularly efficient due to the block-diagonal basis matrices that result.

Let 
\begin {itemize}
\item $\varsigma=\lbrace t_1 < \ldots < t_N \rbrace$ non decreasing  knot sequence 
\item $\left[ t_m,t_{m+1} \right)$ half open interval
\item $B_{mp}$ p-th order polynomial (degree p-1) with finite support over the interval and 0 everywhere else so that  $\sum_{m=1}^{N-p}B_{mp}(x)=1$
\item then  $s(x)=\sum_{m=1}^{N-p}B_{mp}(x)c_m$ 
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}
