\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Preliminaries}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Post-genomics age: the next generation}
\begin{itemize}
\item 'Omics' technologies are becoming increasingly important:
\begin{itemize}
\item The advent of \emph{next generation sequencing}, provides information on many type of \emph{genomic}, \emph{transcriptomic} or \emph{epigenomic} data.
\item The generalization of  high-throughput technologies allow to study biological processes at the different levels at which they happen.

\end{center}
\end{itemize} 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Data integration and systems biology -again}
\begin{itemize}
\item Altogether this new situation opens many fronts and opportunities
\begin{itemize}
\item Statistics and bioinformatics are faced with the need for developing methods and tools for the for integrative analysis of big data sets of different sources and types
\item Biology and medicine are faced with the problem to pose the problems and use the results to improve their understanding in real systems biology approach.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Epigenetics and epigenomics}
\begin{columns}
\begin{column}{.5\linewidth}
\begin{itemize}
\item Epigenetics, \emph{the study of environmental factors on gene expression in DNA}, is one of the disciplines that has experienced a renewed impetus:
\item There is increasing evidence that many differentiation processes are triggered and maintained through epigenetic mechanisms such as \emph{methylation} or \emph{histone modifications}.
\end{itemize} 
\end{column}
 \begin{column}{.5\linewidth}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{./images/epigeneticsMechanisms.jpg}
 \end{column}
\end{columns}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Methylation}
\begin{itemize}
\item One main epigenetic regulatory mechanisms is methylation a process by which a gene's behavior is altered, but the gene itself isn't changed.
\item Essentially methylation acts by inhibiting gene expression that is, the more methylated is a gene the more repressed is its expression
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{./images/methylationAction1.png}
\end{center}
%\item Methylation is seen however as a dual phenomenon\\
%\label{sec-1.8.3}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item A methylated gene is "off"\\
%\label{sec-1.8.3.1}
%\item An unmethlated gene is "on"\\
%\label{sec-1.8.3.2}
%\end{itemize} % ends low level
%\item So in practice an important practical problem is to determine at which methylation level a gene is seen as "methylated" (that is turned off).\\
%\label{sec-1.8.4}
\end{itemize} 
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Methylation and gene expression}
\begin{itemize}
\item Although the relation between methylation and gene expression is probably continuous ("\emph{the more...the less...}"), 
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{./images/DNA-Methylation-and-Gene-Expression-Relationship.jpg}
\end{center}
\item methylation is, in practice, seen as a dual phenomenon
\begin{itemize}
\item A methylated gene is ``off''
\item An unmethlated gene is ``on''
\end{itemize} 
\item Practical problem: \textbf{\emph{at which methylation level a gene is seen as ``methylated'' (that is, it is ``turned off'')?}}
\end{itemize} 

\end{frame}


\subsection{Motivation}
\begin{frame}{A colon cancer study}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item This study originates in a work searching for colon cancer biomarkers.
  \item 30 cell lines characterized by increasing sensitivity to a drug were analyzed using several high-throughput methods:\emph{ transcriptomics, methylation, miRNAs, SNPs}, and \emph{proteomics}.
\item In this work we consider the problem of stablishing which genes were regulated by methylation.
\item For each gene/methylation locus one has 30 points and a scatterplot showing the relation so we need methods to find patterns of scatterplots
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Scatterplot patterns}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{./images/Cluster1_Page_1.pdf}
\end{center}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Previous work}
\begin{itemize}
\item Since measurements for methylation and expression are both
continuous, scatterplots of these signals exhibit an
L-shape pattern. 
\item Assuming that methylation is truly binary, there are two implications:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the reflection point of the L-shape is an appropriate choice
to binarize methylation data, and
\item conditioning on the
binarized on-off methylation status, the continuous valued
methylation data and expression data should be independent,
\end{enumerate}
\item This motivates Liu(2012) to quantify the L-shape pattern using
conditional mutual information (MI). 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}



\subsection{Objectives}

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
\item Study how gene expression is regulated by methylation in a set of colon cancer cell lines.\\
\item Set up a method to detect the level of methylation at which a gene can be considered regulated by methylation (to be "on").\\
\item Compare this method with other existing that have been developed to\\
\begin{itemize}
\item detect methylation thresholds
\item detect patterns in scatterplots
\end{itemize} 
\end{itemize} 
\end{frame}



\section{Methods for pattern selection}

\subsection{Based on Conditional Mutual Information}

\begin{frame}{Conditional Mutual Information}
When studying methylation we are faced with two main questions:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Which genes exhibit an L-shape, and 
  \item what is the optimal threshold for binarizing
methylation data for each L-shape gene.
  \end{itemize}
\begin{block}{The key}
To determine whether methylation and expression of a gene exhibit an L-shape,
compute the conditional Mutual Information (MI) for different choices of threshold
to binarize the methylation data.
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item If we consider the continuous valued methylation and expression data as two random variables
$X$ and $Y$, and denote a nominal threshold as $t$, the conditional MI can be written as a
weighted sum of MIs on the two sides of the threshold.
\[
\mathit{cMI}(t)=I(X,Y|X>t)P(X>t) + I(X,Y|X\le t)P(X\le t)
\]

\item When $t$ is $0$ or $1$, $\mathit{cMI}$ equals to the mutual information derived 
from all data points.

\item For an L-shape gene, as $t$ moves from 0 to 1, $\mathit{cMI}(t)$ first decreases and then
increases, and its value approaches zero when $t$ coincides with the reflection point. 
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Optimal threshold}

Therefore,
\begin{block}{Optimal threshold}
The ratio $r=\frac{\min\{\mathit{cMI}(t)\}}{\mathit{cMI}(0)}$ for an L-shape gene is small, 
and $t^{\ast} = \mathrm{argmin}\{ \mathit{cMI}(t) \}$ is the optimal threshold for 
dichotomizing the methylation data of this gene.
\end{block}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Joint distribution estimator}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item To estimate the MI terms we use a kernel-based estimator, which 
    \begin{itemize}
    \item constructs a joint
probability distribution by applying a Gaussian kernel to each data point,
\item  and estimates
the MI based on the joint distribution. 
    \end{itemize}
\item The estimator is as follows:
\[
I(X,Y) = \frac 1M \sum_{i=1}^M \log\frac{M\sum_{j=1}^M e^{-\frac{1}{2h^2}((x_i-x_j)^2+(y_i-y_j)^2)}}{%
                                      \sum_{j=1}^M e^{-\frac{1}{2h^2}(x_i-x_j)^2} \sum_{j=1}^M e^{-\frac{1}{2h^2}(y_i-y_j)^2}}
\]
where $h$ is a tuning parameter for the kernel width and empirically set $h=0.3$.
  \end{itemize}

% i and j are indices for samples.
% In our analysis, we normalize the expression data to zero mean.
\end{frame}

\subsection{Based on Spline regression}


\begin{frame}{Clustering using Spline regression }
We implemented regression based on  $B$-splines because they are particularly efficient due to the block-diagonal basis matrices that result.

Let 
\begin {itemize}
\item $\varsigma=\lbrace t_1 < \cdots < t_N \rbrace$ non decreasing  knot sequence 
\item $\left[ t_m,t_{m+1} \right)$ half open interval
\item $B_{mp}$ $p$-th order polynomial (degree $p-1$) with finite support over the interval and 0 everywhere else so that  $\sum_{m=1}^{N-p}B_{mp}(x)=1$
\item then  $s(x)=\sum_{m=1}^{N-p}B_{mp}(x)c_m$ 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Clustering using Spline regression (2)}
To represent the curve we set:
\[
y_{ij}=s(x_{ij})
\]
So
\[ 
\mathbf{y}_i=\mathbf{B}_i\mathbf{c}
\]
with
\begin {itemize}
\item $\mathbf{B}_i=\left[ B_{1p}\mathbf{x}_i,B_{2p}\mathbf{x}_i,\dots,B_{Lp}\mathbf{x}_i \right]$ the spline basis matrix
\item $\mathbf{c}$ the vector of spline coefficients.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Clustering using Spline regression (3)}
Algorithm
\begin {enumerate}
\item Selection of the genes with a negative significant correlation
\item Fit cubic regression splines
\item Data to cluster: splines coefficients
\item Calculation of a distance matrix between genes as $1-\rho$
\item Hierarchical clustering 
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\section{Results}

\begin {frame}{Results (1) Splines--based regression}
\begin {itemize}
\item After the previous selection of genes we worked with 191 genes
\item We decided to choose 5 clusters
\item The 2 first clusters included the genes with an L-shape
\end{itemize}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=5cm]{./images/grafic_two_patterns.pdf}
\end{center}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Results (2) Conditional Mutual Information}
\begin {itemize}
\item No previous selection of the genes was needed
%\begin{block}{Three criteria}
\item We filtered for L-shapes using a combination of three criteria:
\begin{itemize}
\item the ratio $r<0.25$
\item unconditioned MI $\mathit{cMI}(0)>0.1$
\item the median expression on the left side of the optimal threshold $t^{\ast}$ is higher
than the median expression on the right side.
\end{itemize}
%\end{block}
\item The parameters are chosen according to a random permutation test (see Liu(2012)).
\item According to the above criteria, a total of 641 genes are selected to be L-shape genes.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Results (3) Comparison between the methods}
The results of both methods that can be summarized in the following table:
\begin{columns}
\begin{column}{.5\linewidth}

\begin{frame}{Conclusions}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item We have found similar results between both methods.
  \item Biological interpretation is still being done by biological
    researchers although results are consistent with the hypothesis
    (we have found genes regulated by methylation).
  \item Sample size is a limiting factor: cMI works better with hundreds of samples but one may have a very small number (real cases: 30, 12)
