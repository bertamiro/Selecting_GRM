\section{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
  \item This study originates in a work searching for colon cancer biomarkers \cite{bazzocco} where  30 cell lines, characterized by increasing sensitivity to a drug, were analyzed using several high-throughput methods including expression microarrays and methylation.
\item Here we consider the problem of establishing which genes were regulated by methylation.
\item For each gene/methylation locus one has 30 points and a scatterplot showing their relation so \textit{we need methods to find patterns of scatterplots}.
  \end{itemize}
